# Coffee Machine Project

This Python project, aptly named "Coffee Machine," simulates a user-friendly interface for a coffee vending machine. The program offers a selection of drinks, including espresso, latte, and cappuccino, each with its own set of ingredients and cost. Users can interact with the machine by placing orders, checking resource levels, and even turning the machine off.

Features:
Menu: Choose from a variety of drinks with predefined ingredients and prices.
Resource Management: The program ensures there are enough resources (water, milk, and coffee) to fulfill each order.
Payment System: Users can insert coins to pay for their chosen beverage.
Transaction Handling: The system validates payments and provides change when necessary.
Reporting: Get real-time updates on available resources and profits.

How to use:
* Run the program in a Python environment (e.g., PyCharm).
* Follow on-screen instructions to place an order or perform other actions.
* Type "report" to check resource levels and profits.
* Type "off" to switch off the coffee machine.
* Feel free to explore, modify, or enhance the code to suit your preferences!
